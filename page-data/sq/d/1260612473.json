I am a software developer from China. ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡³","I am keen on writing high-quality, readable, and maintainable codes with the help of check tools. Also, automating the whole process from development to deployment with CI/CD is one of my interests.","I like to build software with real-world impact and is accessible by everyone and everywhere. So I have taken part in plenty of Web projects, working mainly on the backend side with `Python3` and `Go`. I am trying to dive deeper and deeper into the backend side.","I have built lots of handy tools and platforms for my undergraduate institute. They mainly aim at making the life of students easier.
