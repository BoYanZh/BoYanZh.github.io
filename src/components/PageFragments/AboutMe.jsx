        <p>
            Hello !! My name is Rolwin Reevan Monteiro. I'm a full stack web developer who is 
            passionate about various web technologies. I like to experiment with different web 
            technologies. I have an experience of nearly 3 years working with LAMP stack, MERN stack 
            and ELK stack.
        </p>
        <p>
            Currently I work with mostly Javascript technologies like ReactJS and NodeJS. I also
            have hands on experience working with <b>AWS/ GCLOUD</b> and have deployed applications 
            keeping scalability in mind. Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, SonarQube are some of the cool
            tools I use for <b>CI/ CD</b>. I'm always a learner and a self taught programmer.
        </p>
