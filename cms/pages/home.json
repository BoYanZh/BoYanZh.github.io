    "about": "<p>Hello !! My name is Rolwin Reevan Monteiro. I'm a full-stack web developer who is about various web technologies. I like to experiment with different web technologies. I have an experience of nearly 3 years working with LAMP stack, MERN stack, and ELK stack. Building fancy UI's just like this one that you are seeing ðŸ˜… and writing blogs about tech stacks is what Rolwin loves to do. Check my blog which I update every week for some Javascript and some cool notes on web technologies.</p><p>Currently, I work mostly with Javascript technologies like ReactJS and NodeJS. I also have hands-on experience working with cloud infrastructures like <strong>AWS/GCP</strong> and have deployed applications keeping scalability in mind. Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, SonarQube are some of the cool tools I use for <strong>CI/CD</strong>. I'm always a learner and a self-taught programmer.</p>"
